Outline for Main:
    Step 1:
    Ouput Equations

    Step 2:
    Solve matrix (REF RREF) (Function)

    Step 3:
    Get User input

    Step 4:
    Use user input to find other variables

    Step 5:
    Print variable values


Functions: 
    Solves REF and RREF matrix using given matrix
        Check for libraries that can do this
        or
        Loop that takes given row #loop_index, * -1, + Last row -> LastRow to get REF
        RREF???

    Finding Variables from input
        input = x1
        equation using x1 value to find x2
        equation using x2 value to find x3
        ....
        Until all are found
        (Need Input Validation)
        (Might as well print from inside of this function too)
