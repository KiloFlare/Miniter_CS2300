addition function
	for each row and each column
		add each row/column in sum matrix

subtraction function
	for each row and column
		subtract each row and column

scalar function
	for each row and column
		multiply each number by the scalar

Print the introduction to the program
Print the options

get user input

while not validated input
	if option 1
		set math to addition
	if 2
		set math to subtraction
	if 3
		set math to multiplication by scalar
	if 4
		exit program
	else
		re-run while loop

Prompt for user input for columns and rows

While input isn't validated
	check if input is two numbers 
		if so exit loop
		if not prompt again

Once input is valid get input for first matrix
	for each column and each row get input
		validate input with while loop

Based on math selection either prompt for input for second matrix of prompt for scalar
	for each column and each row get input
		validate input with while loop
	or simply get input
		check that input is number

Print start of output

Based on chosen math pick a function and print its output
	if 1 do addition
	if 2 do subtraction
	if 3 do scalar multiplication
